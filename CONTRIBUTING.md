## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- ✅ Read the [README.md](README.md)
- ✅ Followed the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) guide
- ✅ Understood the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ✅ Reviewed existing issues and PRs

### First Contribution

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Quant-Arbitrage-System-Hyperspeed-X100-Edition.git
   cd Quant-Arbitrage-System-Hyperspeed-X100-Edition
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

---

## Development Setup

### Complete Installation

```bash
# Run one-click setup
./setup.sh

# Verify installation
npm run verify:system
npm run verify:all

# Run tests to ensure everything works
npm run test:comprehensive
```

### Development Tools

**Recommended:**
- Visual Studio Code or similar IDE
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Docker (for testing deployment)
- Git

**Extensions (for VS Code):**
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Python
- Docker

---

## Code Standards

### General Guidelines

1. **Write clear, readable code**
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow existing code style

2. **Keep changes focused**
   - One feature/fix per PR
   - Avoid mixing refactoring with new features
   - Keep PRs reasonably sized

3. **Document your changes**
   - Update README if needed
   - Add/update code comments
   - Include examples

### JavaScript/TypeScript

**Style:**
- Use ES6+ features
- 2-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- camelCase for variables/functions
- PascalCase for classes

**Example:**
```javascript
// Good
const fetchPoolData = async (chainId) => {
  const pools = await getPoolsFromChain(chainId);
  return pools.filter(pool => pool.tvl > 0);
};

// Bad
var fetch_pool_data = function(chain_id) {
  var pools = getPoolsFromChain(chain_id)
  return pools.filter(function(pool) { return pool.tvl > 0 })
}
```

### Python

**Style:**
- Follow PEP 8
- 4-space indentation
- snake_case for variables/functions
- PascalCase for classes
- Type hints where helpful

**Example:**
```python
# Good
def fetch_pool_data(chain_id: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Fetch pool data from specified chain.
    
    Args:
        chain_id: Chain identifier
        
    Returns:
        List of pool dictionaries
    """
    pools = get_pools_from_chain(chain_id)
    return [p for p in pools if p['tvl'] > 0]

# Bad
def FetchPoolData(ChainId):
  pools=get_pools_from_chain(ChainId)
  return [p for p in pools if p['tvl']>0]
```

### Documentation

**Code Comments:**
- Explain "why", not "what"
- Document complex algorithms
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep comments up-to-date

**README Updates:**
- Add new features to features list
- Update installation if dependencies change
- Add examples for new functionality

## Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting

All contributions must:
1. ✅ Pass existing tests
2. ✅ Include new tests for new features
3. ✅ Not reduce test coverage
4. ✅ Pass linting (if configured)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:comprehensive

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:js          # JavaScript tests
npm run test:python      # Python tests
npm run verify:backend   # Backend API tests

# Run system verification
npm run verify:system
```

### Writing Tests

**JavaScript (Jest):**
```javascript
describe('Pool Fetcher', () => {
  test('should fetch pools from Uniswap', async () => {
    const pools = await fetchUniswapPools();
    expect(pools).toBeDefined();
    expect(pools.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
});
```

**Python (pytest):**
```python
def test_fetch_pool_data():
    """Test pool data fetching."""
    pools = fetch_pool_data('ethereum')
    assert pools is not None
    assert len(pools) > 0
```

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum:** 80% coverage for new code
- **Preferred:** 90%+ coverage
- Run coverage reports before submitting
