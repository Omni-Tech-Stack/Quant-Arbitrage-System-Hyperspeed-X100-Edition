# Security Audit & External Review Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the process for conducting security audits, engaging external auditors, and implementing formal verification for the Quant Arbitrage System. While CodeQL provides automated security scanning, external review is essential for identifying economic and logic issues that automated tools may miss.

## Formal Verification

### What is Formal Verification?

Formal verification uses mathematical proofs to ensure smart contracts behave correctly under all possible conditions. It's more rigorous than testing but requires significant effort.

### When to Use Formal Verification

Consider formal verification if:
- Managing > $10M in TVL
- Complex financial logic (e.g., AMM algorithms)
- Critical infrastructure (e.g., bridge contracts)
- High-value single transactions
- Regulatory compliance required

### Formal Verification Tools

#### 1. Certora Prover

```solidity
// Example specification for arbitrage contract
methods {
    executeArbitrage(address[], uint256, uint256) returns (uint256)
    getBalance(address) returns (uint256)
}

// Invariant: Contract should never lose money
invariant profitabilityInvariant()
    getBalance(currentContract) >= initial_balance

// Property: Arbitrage should always be atomic
rule atomicExecution(address[] path, uint256 amountIn, uint256 minOut) {
    env e;
    uint256 balanceBefore = getBalance(e.msg.sender);
    
    executeArbitrage(e, path, amountIn, minOut);
    
    uint256 balanceAfter = getBalance(e.msg.sender);
    
    // Either profit or revert (no partial execution)
    assert balanceAfter >= balanceBefore || lastReverted;
}
```

#### 2. K Framework

Used for formally verifying Ethereum smart contracts:

```bash
# Install K Framework
git clone https://github.com/runtimeverification/k.git
cd k && mvn package

# Verify contract
kevm prove contract.k --definition evm-semantics
```

#### 3. SMT Solvers (Z3, CVC4)

For mathematical property verification:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define variables
amountIn = Real('amountIn')
reserveIn = Real('reserveIn')
reserveOut = Real('reserveOut')
fee = Real('fee')

# Define constraints
s = Solver()
s.add(amountIn > 0)
s.add(reserveIn > 0)
s.add(reserveOut > 0)
s.add(fee >= 0, fee <= 1)

# Calculate output
amountInWithFee = amountIn * (1 - fee)
numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut
denominator = reserveIn + amountInWithFee
amountOut = numerator / denominator

# Property: Output should be less than reserve
s.add(amountOut < reserveOut)

# Verify
if s.check() == sat:
    print("Property holds")
else:
    print("Property violated")
```

### Formal Verification Workflow

1. **Specification Writing** (2-4 weeks)
   - Define properties to verify
   - Write formal specifications
   - Review with developers

2. **Verification Execution** (4-8 weeks)
   - Run verification tools
   - Analyze counterexamples
   - Refine specifications

3. **Bug Fixing** (2-4 weeks)
   - Fix discovered issues
   - Re-run verification
   - Update documentation

4. **Report Generation** (1-2 weeks)
   - Document verified properties
   - Explain assumptions
   - List limitations
