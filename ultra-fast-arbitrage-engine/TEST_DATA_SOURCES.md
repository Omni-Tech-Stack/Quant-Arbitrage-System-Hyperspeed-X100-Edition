reserve_out: 2,000,000
gas_cost: 100
min_profit: 50
```

**Rationale**:
- Gas cost = 100 tokens (roughly $100 at $1/token)
- Min profit = 50 tokens ($50) for profitable threshold
- Pool has 2:1 price ratio (favorable for profit)

**Expected Results**:
```
Optimal size: > 0 (algorithm finds profitable amount)
Size should be < 100,000 (< 10% of pool)
```

**Validation**: ✓ Returns positive value for profitable scenario

---

```

**Rationale**:
- 1:1 price ratio (no arbitrage opportunity)
- Very high gas cost (10,000 tokens = $10,000)
- High minimum profit threshold
- Intentionally unprofitable scenario

**Expected Results**:
```
Optimal size: 0 (no profitable trade exists)
```

**Validation**: ✓ Correctly returns 0 for unprofitable conditions

---

### Test 8: Trade Size Impact Comparison

**Location**: test.js, lines 177-187

**Test Data**:
```javascript
reserve_in: 1,000,000
reserve_out: 2,000,000
small_amount: 1,000 (0.1% of pool)
large_amount: 50,000 (5% of pool)
```

**Rationale**:
- Demonstrates non-linear relationship between size and slippage
- 50x size difference should show significant slippage difference

**Expected Results**:
```
Small trade slippage: ~0.12%
Large trade slippage: ~6-7%
Ratio: ~50-60x higher slippage for 50x size
```

**Validation**: ✓ Large trade has higher slippage (non-linear scaling)

---

### Test 9: Edge Case - Zero Trade Size

### Test 11: Flashloan Amount (Profitable)

**Location**: test.js, lines 224-248

**Test Data**:
```javascript
reserve_in_buy: 1,000,000
reserve_out_buy: 2,000,000 (price = 2.0)
reserve_in_sell: 2,100,000
reserve_out_sell: 1,000,000 (price = 0.476)
flashloan_fee: 0.0009 (0.09%)
gas_cost: 100
```

**Rationale**:
- Buy pool price: 2.0 (can buy 2 tokens B for 1 token A)
- Sell pool price: 0.476 (can sell to get more tokens A back)
- Price difference: 2.0 vs 0.476 = arbitrage opportunity
- Real Aave flashloan fee

**Price Arbitrage Calculation**:
```
Buy 1 token A worth → Get 2 tokens B
Sell 2 tokens B → Get ~4.2 tokens A
Profit: ~4.2 - 1 - 0.0009 - gas = ~3.1 tokens A
```

**Expected Results**:
```
Flashloan amount: > 0 (profitable opportunity found)
Amount < 300,000 (< 30% of reserves)
```

**Validation**: ✓ Returns positive flashloan amount for arbitrage

---

### Test 12: Flashloan Amount (Unprofitable)

**Location**: test.js, lines 251-260

reserve_out_sell: 1,000,000 (price = 1.0)
flashloan_fee: 0.0009
gas_cost: 100
```

**Rationale**:
- Equal prices on both pools (no arbitrage)
- Flashloan fee + gas cost make it unprofitable
- Should return 0

**Expected Results**:
```
Flashloan amount: 0
```

**Validation**: ✓ Returns 0 for equal prices (no opportunity)

---

### Test 13: Market Impact Scaling

**Location**: test.js, lines 263-276

small_flashloan: 10,000 (1%)
large_flashloan: 100,000 (10%)
```

**Rationale**:
- Tests market impact calculation
- 10x size difference should show significant impact difference

**Expected Results**:
```
Small impact: ~1-2%
Large impact: ~15-20%
Large > Small (confirmed)
```

**Validation**: ✓ Market impact increases with flashloan size

---
