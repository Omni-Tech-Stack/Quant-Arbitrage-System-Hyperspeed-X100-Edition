# Models Directory

This directory contains ML models:

- `xgboost_primary.pkl` - Primary XGBoost model (generated by training)
- `onnx_model.onnx` - ONNX optimized model (generated by training)
- `scaler.pkl` - Feature scaler (generated by training)
- `training_metadata.json` - Training session metadata
- `trade_log.jsonl` - Trade execution logs for continuous learning

**Note**: Model files are generated by running:
```bash
python3 train_dual_ai_models.py --validate
```

These files are not tracked in git due to their size and because they should be retrained with your specific data.

Models are retrained daily based on new trade data. See [DUAL_AI_README.md](./DUAL_AI_README.md) for comprehensive documentation.
