# Models Directory

This directory contains ML models for the Quant Arbitrage System.

- `xgboost_primary.pkl` - Primary XGBoost model (generated by training)
- `onnx_model.onnx` - ONNX optimized model (generated by training)
- `scaler.pkl` - Feature scaler (generated by training)
- `training_metadata.json` - Training session metadata
- `trade_log.jsonl` - Trade execution logs for continuous learning

**Note**: Model files are generated by running:
```bash
python train_dual_ai_models.py --validate
```

These files are not tracked in git due to their size and because they should be retrained with your specific data.

Models are retrained daily based on new trade data. See [DUAL_AI_README.md](./DUAL_AI_README.md) for comprehensive documentation.
## Pre-Trained Model

### `arb_ml_latest.pkl` - Latest trained arbitrage ML model

**Status:** âœ… Pre-trained and ready for production

**Description:** 
- Weighted feature-based model for scoring arbitrage opportunities
- Trained on 1000+ synthetic historical arbitrage scenarios
- Scores opportunities based on: profit ratio, confidence, gas efficiency, liquidity, and hop count

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Trained:** 2025-10-18  
**Size:** ~500 bytes  

**Usage:**
```python
from defi_analytics_ml import MLAnalyticsEngine

# Automatically loads the pre-trained model
ml_engine = MLAnalyticsEngine()

# Score opportunities
best = ml_engine.score_opportunities(opportunities)
print(f"Score: {best['ml_score']:.3f}")
```

## Retraining

To retrain the model with updated data:

```bash
python train_ml_model.py
```

This will:
1. Generate synthetic training data (1000 samples)
2. Train the model with weighted feature scoring
3. Validate predictions
4. Save the model to `./models/arb_ml_latest.pkl`
5. Verify the model can be loaded correctly

## Model Files

- `arb_ml_latest.pkl` - Pre-trained model (included)
- `../ml_model.py` - Model class definition
- `../train_ml_model.py` - Training script
- `../defi_analytics_ml.py` - ML analytics engine that loads and uses the model

Models are automatically included in the one-click deployment - no additional setup required!
